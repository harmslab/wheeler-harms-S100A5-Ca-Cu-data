Titration was truncated.
Scheduled: 22
Actual completed: 20

STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 180

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 43
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3 ]


Winning fraction was: 30.0 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 54

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 12

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 2.
The best transition constant was 1.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [74.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0, 73.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 8.

Isotherm is too noisy to determine its type using NITPIC's algorithm.
Final normalized wrmsd was: 0.0134 kcal/mol


FITTING RESULTS
logKa = 6.189
n = 1.329
deltaH = -1.931 kcal/mol
baseline = -185.044 cal/mol

The isotherm did not meet NITPIC's high- or medium-C criteria.

Integration took a total of 5.0 s.
