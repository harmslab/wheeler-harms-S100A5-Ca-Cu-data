STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 179

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 42
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3 ]


Winning fraction was: 25.0 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 45

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 17

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 1.
The best transition constant was 1.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0, 45.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 16.

WARNING: Analysis of SVD-based baseline suggests that too many components have been included.
NITPIC suggests 9 as a good number of components to include



Isotherm is too noisy to determine its type using NITPIC's algorithm.
Final normalized wrmsd was: 0.0262 kcal/mol

NUMERICAL INSTABILITY DETECTED IN FITTING.
MAYDAY.  ABORT.  ABORT.  ABORT.  INSTABILITY ENCOUNTERED.

The isotherm did not meet NITPIC's high- or medium-C criteria.

Integration took a total of 5.0 s.
