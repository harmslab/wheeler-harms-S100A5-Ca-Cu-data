Data come from ITC200 or VP-ITC
File loaded and successfully plotted.


Titration was truncated.
Scheduled: 22
Actual completed: 20

STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 179

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 42
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3 ]


Winning fraction was: 30.0 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 54

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 17

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 2.
The best transition constant was 4.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0, 125.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 17.

WARNING: Analysis of SVD-based baseline suggests that too many components have been included.
NITPIC suggests 11 as a good number of components to include



Isotherm is too noisy to determine its type using NITPIC's algorithm.
Final normalized wrmsd was: 0.0143 kcal/mol


FITTING RESULTS
logKa = 6.472
n = 1.286
deltaH = -1.950 kcal/mol
baseline = -504.791 cal/mol

The isotherm did not meet NITPIC's high- or medium-C criteria.

Integration took a total of 5.0 s.
