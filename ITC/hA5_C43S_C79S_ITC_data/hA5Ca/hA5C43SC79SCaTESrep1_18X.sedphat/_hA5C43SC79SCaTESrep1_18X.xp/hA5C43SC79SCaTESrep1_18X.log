STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 179

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 41
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3 ]


Winning fraction was: 25.0 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 45

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 12

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 1.
The best transition constant was 1.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 77.0, 78.0, 77.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 5.

Isotherm is too noisy to determine its type using NITPIC's algorithm.
Final normalized wrmsd was: 0.0158 kcal/mol


FITTING RESULTS
logKa = 6.319
n = 1.523
deltaH = -2.650 kcal/mol
baseline = -207.442 cal/mol

The isotherm did not meet NITPIC's high- or medium-C criteria.

Integration took a total of 4.0 s.
