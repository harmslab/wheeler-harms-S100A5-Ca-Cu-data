STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 179

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 54
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3   0.35  0.4 ]


Winning fraction was: 40.0 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 72

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 10

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 1.
The best transition constant was 1.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0, 23.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 14.

WARNING: Analysis of SVD-based baseline suggests that too many components have been included.
NITPIC suggests 10 as a good number of components to include



Isotherm is classified as EXOTHERMIC
