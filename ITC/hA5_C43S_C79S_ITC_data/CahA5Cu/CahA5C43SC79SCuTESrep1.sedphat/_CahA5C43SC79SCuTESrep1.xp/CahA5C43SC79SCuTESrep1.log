Data come from ITC200 or VP-ITC
File loaded and successfully plotted.


Titration was truncated.
Scheduled: 22
Actual completed: 16

STARTING RUN #1.
Vertical length of the array input to the 1st SVD is 179

Number of flanking points adjusted to 2.

Initial number of points considered in each injection is 45
Fine-adjusting...
Test fractions were [ 0.1   0.15  0.2   0.25  0.3   0.35  0.4 ]


Winning fraction was: 40.0 percent
No. of points considered restricted to old value because
of increase > 10%

The winning fraction was thus adjusted to: 25 percent

Vertical length of winning array: 45

Checking whether tail is inadvertantly included...
Number of substoichiometric points set to 9

No tail detected.
No adjustment to no. considered points made.
The best PQuadLevel was 1.
The best transition constant was 1.0.
The best anchor box sizes were: [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]
Using Straight for SVD baseline calculations.
The best number of SVD components to include based on RMSD is 9.

Isotherm is classified as EXOTHERMIC

Saturated Plateau was: -0.507265349855.
Stoichiometric Plateau was: -6.6760119885.
Length of first third: 4.
Length of last third: 5.
transitionRegionLowWide was: -3.76786692584.
transitionRegionHighWide was: -1.21957263505.
The transition points are: 9 10 


The isotherm appears to be of the high-C type.
Extending injection times in transition region by 20.0%.
Final normalized wrmsd was: 0.0381 kcal/mol


FITTING RESULTS
logKa = 6.156
n = 1.172
deltaH = -4.108 kcal/mol
baseline = -218.227 cal/mol

Integration took a total of 4.0 s.
